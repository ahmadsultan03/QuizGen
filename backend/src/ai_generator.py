    Your task is to generate a multiple-choice quiz question on AI/ML based on the specified difficulty level.

    For easy questions: Focus on basic ML/AI concepts such as supervised vs unsupervised learning, types of ML algorithms, basic terminology.
    For medium questions: Cover intermediate topics like overfitting, bias-variance tradeoff, types of neural networks, feature engineering, common algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, SVM).
    For hard questions: Include advanced topics such as backpropagation, gradient descent variants, regularization, attention mechanisms, or recent advancements like transformers.

    Return the challenge in the following JSON structure:
    {
        "title": "The question title",
        "options": ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3", "Option 4"],
        "correct_answer_id": 0, // Index of the correct answer (0-3)
        "explanation": "Detailed explanation of why the correct answer is right"
    }

    Make sure the options are plausible but with only one clearly correct answer. 
    Randomize the position of the correct answer among the four options â€” it should not always be first.
